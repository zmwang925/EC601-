 - User Stories
   1. I, a tourist to Boston, want to know what I think about a scenic spot on twitter. So use the scenic spot as a keyword to analyze the mood of the tweets about the scenic spot sent by netfriend. If the analysis shows that the emotion is relatively more positive, it is worth going, and vice versa.
   2. I, a reporter, want to get people's opinions about something on twitter, so I use this product to analyze people's emotions about something according to the keywords of the event.
