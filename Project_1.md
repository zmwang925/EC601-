Building 3D scenes from 2D images using ML algorithms

## Problem Statement
The basic content of this subject is to use the relevant algorithms of machine learning to establish the 3D model of the object based on the 2D images. The goal is to infer and complete the information of another dimension according to the images of different angles of the object. In recent decades, computer graphics, virtual reality and communication have important requirements for 3D content, which leads to the change of demand focus. Many existing systems for building 3D models are built around special hardware, so the cost is high and can not meet the requirements of their new applications.

## Applications
After some investigation and research, I summarized several meaningful applications of this topic.
1. Building 3D models of museum collections, such as porcelain, silverware and sculpture, can better manage and preserve the information of cultural relics. The 3D model obtained from multi angle photos can also be uploaded to the museum website for tourists to enjoy the museum collection in more detail and comprehensively online.
2. The home decoration company can conduct 3D modeling of the furniture to be sold according to the multi angle pictures of the furniture. In this way, complex manual modeling of each furniture can be avoided, and consumers can directly choose the furniture they need online according to the 3D model of the furniture.
3. Using multi angle images of houses and buildings for 3D modeling, such as modeling historic buildings, can avoid complex manual modeling, better retain the details of the relics and facilitate the archiving of the relics.
4. In surgery, modeling the patient's body structure or organs can make it more convenient for doctors to analyze the diseased organs more clearly and as a whole, and can also find the focus more clearly.

It can be seen that three-dimensional reconstruction of objects according to two-dimensional images is of great significance in all fields of society. In the field of archaeology, we can more comprehensively and truly retain the real appearance and specific details of historical relics. In business, commodities can be modeled to help consumers browse online and promote the development of online economy. In the medical field, three-dimensional reconstruction technology can be combined with traditional two-dimensional diagnosis methods to help doctors better diagnose patients' diseases. For example, 3D reconstruction of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) combined with CT or MRI images can help doctors better diagnose patients and formulate treatment plans.

## Literature Review
After I looked up some information, I had a general understanding of the implementation method of this subject. 3D model reconstruction through multi angle images of objects is also called multi-view object reconstruction, which is usually realized by solving the stereo view reconstruction problem of each pair of continuous images. Performing stereo reconstruction requires photographing paired images with a large number of visible overlaps of physical points. Then we need to find the corresponding points so that we can use triangulation to find the 3D coordinates of these points. The first step should be finished by calibrating the camera in order to use the theory of epipolar geometry. After knowing the camera's position and rotation and knowing 8 or more physical points with matching known positions in two photos (when using the eight point algorithm), we could calculate the fundamental and essential matrices using only matrix theory and use these to rectify the images. 

Also, there is another method that does not need the camera parameters and works for unknown camera set-ups which called uncalibrated stereo reconstruction. The system is an uncalibrated active vision system, which is composed of camera and video projector. Geometrically speaking, this is a camera to camera system, in which one camera is replaced by a projector. Uncalibrated vision system based on perspective projection equipment is prone to unmeasurable scaling parameters. In order to solve this problem, a laser pointer is installed on the projector. In the present work, coded structured light is used to obtain dense corresponding points, so as to obtain a more detailed shape representation. Experiments using the system show that the system can reconstruct dense and accurate three-dimensional shapes.

For me, a beginner of machine learning, the second way, that is, uncalibrated stereo reconstruction, is more difficult and more difficult to achieve in hardware facilities. Therefore, I prefer the first method, that is, using a calibrated camera to complete the construction of the coordinate system.
